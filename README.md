# Scenarios
```Queue or Hash Table``` (if this is a drive thru, assuming people aren't cutting in front of one another, it's like the printer question. If customers are placing orders ahead of time, and can arrive in any order, a hash table would be much better, with an order number or customer name as the key and the order details as the value).
